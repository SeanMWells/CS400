  <h1>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h1>
  <p> This page details Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path 
between nodes.</p>
  <h2 class="section-heading">Algorithm Steps and Things to Keep in 
Mind</h2>
    <ol>
      <h3>Visited Nodes</h3>
        <main id="main-section"><li>An essential aspect to Dijkstra's 
algorithm is knowing 
which nodes have already been visited. This can be done via a mapping 
function or structure. It prevents us from revisiting or updating 
(extending) the shortest known path of a given node from the 
starting location. This process involves updating when a node has 
been visited, from which node we were able to reach this node, and 
the cumulative cost of the path we took.</li></main>
      <h3>Priority Queue</h3>
        <main id="main-section"><li>A priority queue that is updated with 
all of the outgoing 
edges of nodes we visit, prioritized by the lowest edge weights, is 
the most efficient way to find the shortest path to every node in the 
graph.</li></main>
      <h3>Rebuild Path</h3>
        <main id="main-section"><li>Once we have reached the desired node, 
we backtrack using 
the previously mentioned mapping structure. We have already obtained 
the total cost of the path it took to reach the destination node, and 
following the trail of predecessor nodes until we reach the starting 
node provides us with the shortest possible path (if the starting and 
destination nodes are feasibly connected).</li></main>
    </ol>
    <p>The following is a full example detailing the process of 
finding the shortest path from start node A to H.</p>
